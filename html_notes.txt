Internet - 
1. It is just a long piece of wire which connects all the computers in the world. Like one is Seattle and one in London.
2. The computers can talk to each other and transfer data through this wire.
3. Some of these computers have to be only 24*7 ready to serve the requested files when we access a website. These computers are called servers.
4. Servers - Provide data that is requested. 
5 Client - The computer that the user is using to access the internet.

Client (www.google.com) -> ISP (Spectrum or Jio) -> DNS Server (Domain Name System Server) : Sort of like a phone book; has
lots of IP addresses of each domain.

How do websites work?

Server back sends the files and data request by the client in HTML, CSS and JS.
HTML - responsible for content in the website like text, images, buttons.
CSS - responsible for color and styling.
JS - Allows the website to do things, adds functionality to a website. 
     It turns a static website into a dynamic one.


HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)- 

HyperText - Text which links to other text or file in the same website or a different website.
Markup Language - Tags are used to do markup in HTML.

Browsers like Chrome, Safari etc. take HTML, CSS and JS and render them into a website.
