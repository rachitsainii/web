Internet - 
1. It is just a long piece of wire which connects all the computers in the world. Like one is Seattle and one in London.
2. The computers can talk to each other and transfer data through this wire.
3. Some of these computers have to be only 24*7 ready to serve the requested files when we access a website. These computers are called servers.
4. Servers - Provide data that is requested. 
5 Client - The computer that the user is using to access the internet.

Client (www.google.com) -> ISP (Spectrum or Jio) -> DNS Server (Domain Name System Server) : Sort of like a phone book; has
lots of IP addresses of each domain.

How do websites work?

Server back sends the files and data request by the client in HTML, CSS and JS.
HTML - responsible for content in the website like text, images, buttons.
CSS - responsible for color and styling.
JS - Allows the website to do things, adds functionality to a website. 
     It turns a static website into a dynamic one.


HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)- 

HyperText - Text which links to other text or file in the same website or a different website.
Markup Language - Tags are used to do markup in HTML.

Browsers like Chrome, Safari etc. take HTML, CSS and JS and render them into a website.


HTML Tags - 
1. Heading Element : <h1> to <h6>
Some Do's and Dont's
- Don't have more than one <h1>.
- Don't skip a level when creating heading elements.



2. Paragraph Element : <p> 
https://www.lipsum.com - Lorem Ipsum
https://www.baconipsum.com 


3. Void Elements : <hr/> and <br/>
<hr />  - horizontal rule
<br /> -  line break
Some Do's and Don'ts:
1. Use <br /> element only when it is absolutely necessary. Try to break things in paragraphs.
2. Can use <br> and <hr> as well.


4. List Elements : Ordered and Unordered Lists
Unordered List : 
<ul> 
    <li> </li>
    <li> </li>
    <li> </li>
</ul> 


Ordered List :
<ol>
    <li> </li>
    <li> </li>
    <li> </li>
</ol>


5. Nesting and Indentation 
 Nesting a List within a List : Indentation is very important here, to increase the readability of code.

    <ul> 
        <li> </li>
        <li> </li>
        <li> </li>
         <ul>
             <li> </li>
             <li> </li>
         </ul>
        <li> </li>
    </ul>



6. Anchor Element <a> :
<a href="https://www.google.com"> Google </a>



7. HTML Attributes :
<tag attribute=value anotherattribute=value> Content </tag>


8. Images :
<img src="url" alt="forest at sunset/>
alt stands for alternate text : Used for people with visual impairment, it describes the image.

- It is also a void element, i.e. it doesn't have a closing tag.

FILEPATHS -
Can direct to a file or a folder. It is used to direct the computer to look inside a specific location in the hard drive.

Absolute File Paths : Relative to the root of the computer. root/Project/Images/cat.png
Really useful when navigating on a computer.

Relative File Path : More useful for web development. In this case we are not in the root folder.
For example a Project folder has an index.html file, another folder called Images containing a cat.png image. 
To access that image inside Index.html we can use ../../Images/cat.png path. 


../ -> Look in the higher directories.
./ -> Stays in the current directory.


MULTI-PAGE websites : 
Use <a> to provide a link to different html files (webpages).


HTML Boilerplate :

<!DOCTYPE html>   -> Tells the browser which version of HTML the file is written in.
<html lang="en">  -> Root of the document, every element goes inside the opening and closing tags of <html>. lang is the language used for targeted users.
    <head>        -> Important info about our website is placed, but not displayed to the user. It helps in rendering the webite.
        <meta charset = "UTF8">  -> Makes sure the characters used in the website are displayed properly.
        <title> My Website </title> -> What get's displayed in the tab bar.
    </head>

    <body>  -> All of the content of the website goes here, like headings, images etc.
        <h1> Hello world! </h1> -> Website Content
    </body>
</html>


HOSTING THE WEBSITE :
Process of making the website available from anywhere.
Github Pages
