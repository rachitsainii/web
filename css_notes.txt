CSS : Cascading Style Sheets.

A Cascade is like a waterfall, we have different levels. 
Start from the most genenral, all the way down to the most specific.

- CSS ia a style sheet language.

Ways of adding CSS to an HTML file :

1. INLINE : Goes in the same line of the HTML code.
            <html style="background:blue">    -> style="property:value"
            </html>
            Useful for adding CSS style to just a single element on the HTML page.
            Not recommended to use for entire document, only for specific sections or elements.

2. EXTERNAL : Live in a completely different .css file.
              Inside this css file we write the css rules.
              Linking - Add a <link /> element in the head section. <link rel="stylesheet" href="file_address"/>
              Used most commonly in Web Dev.

3. INTERNAL :  <style> 
                  SELECTER-> html {
                        background: red;
                    }
                </style>
                Can apply to anywhere in the HTML document.
                Useful for applying only to one HTML document. Not to be used on Mutlipage website.

CSS Selectors :
property:value; // E.g - color:blue;

h1{  // here h1 is a CSS selector.
    property:value;
}

1. Class Selectors - Use class selectors by specifying the class of the HTML.

2. Id Selector - id="main".

3. Attribute Selector -
 p[draggable] { p->HTML element [draggable] -> attribute (Select all paragraphs element with attribute draggable)
    color:red;
}

4. Universal Selector : * -> Select all

* {
    color : red;
}

Difference b/w ID and Class Selector :
Class Selector can be applied to many element.
ID selector should be appliedto only single element.
